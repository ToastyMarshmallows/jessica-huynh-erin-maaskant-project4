// We want to create a hero database where the user searches the heroes and the hero information is returned into the html
   // search by name
   // search by affliation
   // stretch - user can search via pinpoints on map and include the distance between user and hero's base of operation

// 1. Get hero data from the Overwatch API
   // hero name, real name, age, height, health, armour, shield, affliation, and base of operations, description
// 2. Display their info on the page

// Hero Images 
// Create an empty array to store hero images

// Set up user search form

// Display hero information upon user's search
// Also display hero images with hero information

// Stretch - on the click of hero's base of operations, display hero location with google maps API
   // second search method - display pinpoints of hero's base of operations on a world map, when the user click's the pin, display hero information
